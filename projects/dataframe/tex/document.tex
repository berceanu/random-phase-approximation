\begin{abstract}
The r-process nucleosynthesis is responsible for the creation of about half of
the atomic nuclei heavier than iron, under extreme density and temperature
conditions. As such, the temperature dependence of neutron capture cross
sections and rates is important for determining the reaction dynamics. As shown
by the sensitivity study in~\cite{Mumpower2016}, neutron capture dynamics
on Sn isotopes is very important for r-process study.  So in this work, we
study the effect of finite temperature on the neutron-capture cross sections and
rates of even-even tin isotopes, with neutron numbers between 76 and 96.  We
compute the E1 dipole strengths, for both zero and finite temperature, using
relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) + quasiparticle random phase approximation
(QRPA) and finite-temperature relativistic mean-field (FTRMF) +
finite-temperature random-phase approximation (FTRPA), respectively. We use the
TALYS code for computing the corresponding cross sections, replacing its default
E1 dipole data with ours.  We find out the main effect of temperature is to
increase the low-lying E1 strength, and as a result, the neutron capture cross
sections are increased several times up to the temperature of 2 MeV.

\section{Introduction}
\LaTeX\ looks more difficult than it is. It is
almost as easy as $\pi$. See how easy it is to make special
symbols such as $\alpha$,
$\beta$, $\gamma$,
$\delta$, $\sin x$, $\hbar$, $\lambda$, $\ldots$\ . We also can make
subscripts,
$A_{x}$, $A_{xy}$, and superscripts, $e^x$, $e^{x^2}$, and
$e^{a^b}$. We will use \LaTeX, which is based on \TeX\ and has
many higher-level commands (macros) for formatting, making
tables, etc.

We just made a new paragraph. Extra lines and spaces make no
difference. Note that all formulas are enclosed by
\$ and occur in \textit{math mode}.

The default font is Computer Modern. It includes \textit{italics},
\textbf{boldface},
\textsl{slanted}, and \texttt{monospaced} fonts.

\section{Equations}
Let us see how easy it is to write equations.
\begin{equation}
\Delta =\sum_{i=1}^N w_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2.
\end{equation}
It is a good idea to number equations, but we can have a
equation without a number:
\begin{equation}
P(x) = \frac{x - a}{b - a}, \nonumber
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
g = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2\pi}. \nonumber
\end{equation}

We can give an equation a label so that we can refer to it later.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ising}
E = -J \sum_{i=1}^N s_i s_{i+1},
\end{equation}
Equation~\eqref{eq:ising} expresses the energy of a configuration
of spins in the Ising model.

We can define our own macros to save typing. For example, suppose
that we introduce the macros:
\begin{verbatim}
 \newcommand{\lb}{{\langle}}
 \newcommand{\rb}{{\rangle}}
\end{verbatim}
\newcommand{\lb}{{\langle}}
\newcommand{\rb}{{\rangle}}
Then we can write the average value of $x$ as
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\lb x \rb = 3
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}
The result is
\begin{equation}
\lb x \rb = 3.
\end{equation}

Examples of more complicated equations:
\begin{equation}
I = \! \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\,dx \label{eq:fine}.
\end{equation}
We can do some fine tuning by adding small amounts of horizontal
spacing:
\begin{verbatim}
 \, small space       \! negative space
\end{verbatim}
as is done in Eq.~\eqref{eq:fine}.

We also can align several equations:
\begin{align}
a & = b \\
c &= d,
\end{align}
or number them as subequations:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
a & = b \\
c &= d.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

We can also have different cases:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mdiv}
m(T) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{($T > T_c$)} \\
\big(1 - [\sinh 2 \beta J]^{-4} \big)^{\! 1/8} & \text{($T < T_c$)},
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
write matrices
\begin{align}
\textbf{T} &=
\begin{pmatrix}
T_{++} \hfill & T_{+-} \\
T_{-+} & T_{--} \hfill 
\end{pmatrix}, \nonumber \\
& =
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{\beta (J + B)} \hfill & e^{-\beta J} \hfill \\
e^{-\beta J} \hfill & e^{\beta (J - B)} \hfill
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
and 
\newcommand{\rv}{\textbf{r}}
\begin{equation}
\sum_i \vec A \cdot \vec B = -P\!\int\! \rv \cdot
\hat{\mathbf{n}}\, dA = P\!\int \! {\vec \nabla} \cdot \rv\, dV.
\end{equation}

\section{Tables}
Tables are a little more difficult. TeX
automatically calculates the width of the columns.


\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|r|l|}
\hline
lattice & $d$ & $q$ & $T_{\rm mf}/T_c$ \\
\hline
square & 2 & 4 & 1.763 \\
\hline
triangular & 2 & 6 & 1.648 \\
\hline
simple cubic & 3 & 6 & 1.330 \\
\hline
bcc & 3 & 8 & 1.260 \\
\hline
fcc & 3 & 12 & 1.225 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:5/tc}Comparison of mean-field predictions
for the critical temperature of the Ising model with exact results
and the best known estimates for different dimensions 
and lattice symmetries.}
\end{table}

\section{Lists}

Some example of formatted lists include the
following:


\section{Figures}

We can make figures bigger or smaller by scaling them. Figure~\ref{fig:colormesh}
has been scaled by 60\%.

% \printinunitsof{in}\prntlen{\linewidth}


\section{Literal text}
It is desirable to print program code as it is typed in a
monospaced font. Use \verb+\begin{verbatim}+ and
\verb+\end{verbatim}+ as in the following example:
\begin{verbatim}
double y0 = 10; // example of declaration and assignment statement
double v0 = 0;  // initial velocity
double t = 0;   // time
double dt = 0.01; // time step
double y = y0;
\end{verbatim}
The command \verb+\verbatiminput{programs/Square.java}+ allows
you to list the file \texttt{Square.java} in the directory
programs.

\section{Special Symbols}

\subsection{Common Greek letters}

These commands may be used only in math mode. Only the most common
letters are included here.

$\alpha, 
\beta, \gamma, \Gamma,
\delta,\Delta,
\epsilon, \zeta, \eta, \theta, \Theta, \kappa,
\lambda, \Lambda, \mu, \nu,
\xi, \Xi,
\pi, \Pi,
\rho,
\sigma, 
\tau,
\phi, \Phi,
\chi,
\psi, \Psi,
\omega, \Omega$

\subsection{Special symbols}

The derivative is defined as
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}
{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
f(x) \to y \quad \mbox{as} \quad x \to
x_{0}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
f(x) \mathop {\longrightarrow}
\limits_{x \to x_0} y
\end{equation}

\noindent Order of magnitude:
\begin{equation}
\log_{10}f \simeq n
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
f(x)\sim 10^{n}
\end{equation}
Approximate equality:
\begin{equation}
f(x)\simeq g(x)
\end{equation}
\LaTeX\ is simple if we keep everything in proportion:
\begin{equation}
f(x) \propto x^3.
\end{equation}

Finally we can skip some space by using commands such as
\begin{verbatim}
\bigskip    \medskip    \smallskip    \vspace{1pc}
\end{verbatim}
The space can be negative.
