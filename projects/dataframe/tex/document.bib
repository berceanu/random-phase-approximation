 abstract = {The tensor terms of the Skyrme effective interaction are included in the self-consistent Hartree–Fock plus Random Phase Approximation (HF + RPA) model. The Gamow–Teller (GT) strength function of 90Zr and 208Pb are calculated with and without the tensor terms. The main peaks are moved downwards by about 2 MeV when including the tensor contribution. About 10% of the non-energy weighted sum rule is shifted to the excitation energy region above 30 MeV by the RPA tensor correlations. The contribution of the tensor terms to the energy weighted sum rule is given analytically, and compared to the outcome of RPA.},
